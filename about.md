###Hello, I'm Lisa!

I’m currently a PhD student from Department of Statistics, Dalhousie University. I have been doing some multi class classification in data mining. Now I’m learning some text mining and model combination. I enjoy making and showing pretty R plots to my audience, because I believe one good picture can tell everything. I’m a big fan of Github and Knitr.

I love [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lisaling/) and pole dancing (my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lisaling22)).
